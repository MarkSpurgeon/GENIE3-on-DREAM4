# GENIE3-on-DREAM4
GENIE3 (Huynh-Thu et al.) uses random forest variable importance to recover gene regulatory networks, and was the best performer in the DREAM4 *In Silico Multifactorial* challenge. This project does the following:

**(1)** Implements the GENIE3 gene regulatory network algorithm using base R functions

**(2)** Analyses data from the DREAM4 In Silico Size 100 Multifactorial subchallenge

**(3)** Compares performance to that of the original GENIE3 algorithm which was the best performer in this subchallenge

*In Progress* **(4)** Improving algorithm by accounting for indirect associations that may lead to spurious detections
